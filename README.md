# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18
## Overview
In this assingment we created an analysis for  clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Our client is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Here we have created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data was processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we used on a clustering algorithm. Finally, we will share the data visualizations with the client.
